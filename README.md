## Setup — 5 Steps

### Step 1 — MySQL Setup
Open MySQL Workbench (or terminal) and run both SQL files in order:
```sql
SOURCE /path/to/database/schema.sql;
SOURCE /path/to/database/sample_data.sql;
```

### Step 2 — JDBC Driver
`mysql-connector-j-9.6.0.jar` is already in `lib/`. No action needed.

### Step 3 — Configure Database Connection
Open `src/main/java/com/smartclassroom/util/DBConnection.java` and update:
```java
private static final String DB_USER = "root";        // your MySQL username
private static final String DB_PASS = "your_pass";   // your MySQL password
```

### Step 4 — Compile

**Windows:**
```cmd
compile.bat
```

**Linux/Mac:**
```bash
chmod +x compile.sh && ./compile.sh
```

### Step 5 — Run

**Windows:**
```cmd
java -cp ".;out;lib\mysql-connector-j-9.6.0.jar" com.smartclassroom.Main
```

**Linux/Mac:**
```bash
java -cp ".:out:lib/mysql-connector-j-9.6.0.jar" com.smartclassroom.Main
```

## Key Design Points

| Concept | How it's implemented |
|---|---|
| Password security | SHA-256 via `AuthService.hash()` — matches MySQL's `SHA2(p,256)` |
| Anonymous feedback | `feedback` table has NO `student_id` column — identity impossible to trace |
| Technician auto-assign | `IssueDAO.getTechnicianForRoom()` looks up `room_technicians` table |
| Attendance | `ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE` prevents double-marking for same day |
| Announcements (ALL) | `broadcastAll()` sends to every active user — not `broadcastToRole("ALL")` |
| Quiz availability | Students only see quizzes for courses they are enrolled in |
| Room availability | Technician view compares today's timetable against all rooms to show free/busy |
| Quiz | Full MCQ flow: create → scheduled date → take → instant score → save submission |
| OOP layers | Controller → Service → DAO → Model — clean separation |
| DB connection | Singleton pattern in `DBConnection` — one connection reused throughout |
